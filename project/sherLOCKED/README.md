# Root Unity Project Folder
Contains all of the project files

## Directory Structure

Assets: Actual project files that make the game what it is. Directories are laid out fairly intuitively. Most files are .unity files that are used by the Unity editor to work out how to display the various assets. Scripts we wrote for the project can be found in the "Scripts" directory, separated by function. 

Packages: External Packages (none of our own work in here).

Project Settings: All the settings for how the project is run, built, and exported.
