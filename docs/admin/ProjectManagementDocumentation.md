# Project Management Documentation
*A document to briefly describe how we will manage the project*

We will:
## Work Distribution ##
- split the written work 50/50
    * Alice to do more if Conor needs to focus on coding
- have Conor to focus on the broader scope of work
- have Alice to focus on the smaller details

## Management Techniques ##
- have Conor as project manager
- have group meetings every Wednesday at 12pm in person
- use a Scrum/Sprint methodology
- use a project board created in GitHub

## Code Management ##
- use Simmer.io to publish our game
- use Github to store our code
- use Unity to write our code
