#Question Plan
- This plan includes questions for each level to be asked, also included are the answers followed by 2 fake answers as the questions will be presented as multiple choice.
- When adding questions to the game, the answers should be mixed up so that the correct answer is in a different position for each question to ensure there isn't a pattern for users to guess to aid learning.
- Each level should have at least 10 questions.
