#Question Plan
- This plan includes questions for each level to be asked, also included are the answers followed by 2 fake answers as the questions will be presented as multiple choice.
- When adding questions to the game, the answers should be mixed up so that the correct answer is in a different position for each question to ensure there isn't a pattern for users to guess to aid learning.
- Each level should have at least 10 questions.

## Level 1
- “First things first, I need to see what went wrong with the security in the house. I need to define the CIA triad – now what does it stand for?”
    - *= Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability*
    - *= Confidentiality, Identity, Acceptability*
    - *= Competence, Identity, Availability*

- "Let's look at confidentiality. Before I can find any clues that link to it, I need to define it. Select the definition of confidentiality"
    - *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*
    - *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    - *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*

- "Looking at this clue here reminds me of an element from the CIA triad, the definition of it is, 'it prevents unauthorised modification of data and systems' but which one of the elements does it belong to?"
    - *= Integrity*
    - *= Availability*
    - *= Identity*

- "This clue is fascinating I think it's to do with the availability element of the CIA triad. I should check by looking at the definition. Select the definition of availability"
    - *= preventing downtime of systems or inability to access data/information*
    - *= preventing unauthorized modification of data and systems*
    - *= preventing unauthorized disclosure of information. Includes secrecy, privacy*

- "Hmmm, it looks like the victim, Ginny, had granted someone permission to access a file, what is the name of this process?"
    - *= Authorisation*
    - *= Authentication*
    - *= Apple bobbing*

- "I wonder if the hacker managed to gain authentication? Select the definition of authentication"
    - *= the process of confirming the truth or correctness of the claimed artefact or identity*
    - *= the process of granting permission to someone/thing to do some action (e.g., access files)*
    - *= the process of hanging a picture on the wall*

- "This clue looks linked to the factor Non-repudiation to me. Select the definition of non-repudiation"
    - *= ability for parties to prove that a message has been sent by a specific person, and received by a specific person. Therefore neither party can claim they did not send/receive the message.*
    - *= the process of granting permission to someone/thing to do some action (e.g., access files)*
    - *= the process of confirming the truth or correctness of the claimed artefact or identity*

- "This clue shows we should think about the computer security of this mansion. Select which of the following could be used to describe computer security"
    - *= A measure of how well a system resists misuse from either an insider or an outsider*
    - *= An apple a day keeps the doctor away*
    - *= A measure of how well a system stores files*
 
- "Hmmm let's look at cyber security in more detail. The collection of what can be used to protect the cyber environment, organisation and user's assets?"
    - *= Collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance and technologies*
    - *= Collection of connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems*
    - *= Collection of scout badges*

- "This clue seems to point in the direction of computer security. Which of the following can be used to describe what computer security is?"
    - *= Freedom from undesirable events in a system, either accidental or malicious*
    - *= Freedom from desirable events in a system, either accidental or malicious*
    - *= Freedom from desirable events in a computer, either accidental or malicious*

## Level 2
- "It looks like there was a vulnerability in the house's system - how would I define what a vulnerability is to Ginny?"
    - *= Weakness in the system, could originate from design*
    - *= Strength in the system, could originate from implementation*
    - *= Weakness in the owner, could originate from context*

- "I think Ginny is still under threat from the hacker - can you help me define it to her?"
    - *= Circumstances or events that could potentially lead to harm or loss*
    - *= Weakness in the system, could originate from design*
    - *= Attempt to exploit a vulnerability*

- "From this clue I'm deducting that there was an attempt to exploit a vulnerability - what does this define"
    - *= Attack*
    - *= Vulnerability*
    - *= Threat*

- "We need to get control back over this house for Ginny, what's the definition of control?"
    - *= Used to remove or limit the vulnerability*
    - *= Attempt to exploit a vulnerability*
    - *= Circumstances or events that could potentially lead to harm or loss*

- "I know there are 4 types of attackers, but what are they again?"
    - *= Amateurs, Crackers, Hacktivists, Terrorists*
    - *= Amateurs, Biscuits, Hacktivists, Terrorists*
    - *= Amateurs, Cracker, Lacktivists, Terrorists*

- "Security is so hard to get right, which of the following is a reason why?"
    - *= Arms race, Weakest links, resistance against overheads*
    - *= Arms wrestle, Weakest links, attacks "outside the box"*
    - *= You are the weakest link, goodbye*

- "I need to start thinking about which type of security attack occured in this house, which of the following types of security attacks?"
    - *= Interception, Interruption, Modification, Fabrication*
    - *= Interception, Investigationm, Modification, Fascination*
    - *= Interception, Interruption, Modelisation, Fabrication*

- "I think the hacker may have intercepted or eavesdropped to attck the house, whats a definition for this again?"
    - *= An unauthorised party gains access to an asset*
    - *= An asset is destroyed or becomes unavailable*
    - *= An unauthorized party modifies an asset*

- "There's many reasons why security is important, select a real reason"
    - *= A legitimate user could be authenticated and then remove files from their server*
    - *= The policeman said so*
    - *= You could be directed to a safe website*

- "This clue is suggesting a replay attack, how would you define a replay attack?"
    - *= The attacker could send extra copies of your message*
    - *= Even with originality guaranteed, an adversary could intercept your message and retransmit it with a delay*
    - *= Even encrypted, an adversary could modify the message*
