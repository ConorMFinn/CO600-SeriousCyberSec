Sherry: You must be Ginny, you called my office about a hacking?
Ginny: Yes. That is correct. Someone took control of the house!
Ginny: We had all these improvements installed and they just went haywire last night.
Sherry: Interesting, I'll have a look around and see what I can find. 
Sherry: Once I've gained enough INTUITION, I should be able to work out what really happened here.
Ginny: You are supposed to be the best in the business, I hope you live up to your REPUTATION.
Sherry: Of course Ma'am, I'll have this case cracked in no time!
Sherry: (I should make sure my deductions are correct. Too many errors and I'll be fired!)
Ginny: Best of luck to you, Sherry.
